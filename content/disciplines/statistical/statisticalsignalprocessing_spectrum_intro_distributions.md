## Introduction

## Module overview
The concepts covered in this module are:

1. <a href="../mathematicalbackground_probability_definitions">Definitions of probability</a> - In order to describe how uncertainty affects experiments some general definitions are clarified. Furthermore, the basic theory of probability theory is explained.
2. <a href="../mathematicalbackground_probability_variables">Random variables</a> - Dealing with uncertainty requires a paradigm shift from deterministic variables to the so-called random variables. In this section, we introduce random variables and explain how to characterize them.
3. <a href="../mathematicalbackground_probability_functions">Functions and pairs of random variables</a> - Random variables are often not present in their simplest form. Real-world problems usually involve functions of random variables and/or multiple random variables. This section covers how to deal with functions and pairs of random variables.
