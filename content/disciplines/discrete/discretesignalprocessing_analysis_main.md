## Module overview
This module will analyze discrete-time filters not only in the time-domain, but also in other domains, such as the frequency domain.

1. <a href="../discretesignalprocessing_analysis_frequency/">Frequency response of finite impulse response filters</a> - The most basic filter is defined as a finite impulse response filter. This section discusses the behaviour of the filter in the frequency domain.
2. <a href="../discretesignalprocessing_analysis_lti/">Frequency response of LTI systems</a> (in progress) - The frequency response can be extended to infinite impulse response filters, where other aspects are also of importance, such as stability.
3. **System functions** (to be added) - The difference equation can easily be converted to a system function through the z-transform, which offers us with valuable insight of the operations of the filter.
