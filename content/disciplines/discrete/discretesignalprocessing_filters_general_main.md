## Introduction
A structural representation using interconnected basic building blocks is the first step in hardware or software implementation of an LTI filter. The structural representation provides the relation between some pertinent internal variables with the input and the output that in turn provide the keys to the implementation. There are various forms of the structural representation of filters. We review in this module structures for non-recursive and recursive systems. Then we will introduce the transposition theorem which is a general method of deriving from any given structure another structure from which the input- output properties remain unchanged. Finally, we will discuss several special filter structures.
