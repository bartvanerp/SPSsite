## Module overview
This module will cover some very basic characteristics and examples of signals in the discrete-time domain.

1. **Signal properties** (to be added) - In the characterization of signals, several properties can be determined and observed which prove to be useful in mathematical calculations.
2. <a href="../discretesignalprocessing_signals_basics">Elementary signals</a> (in progress) - All discrete-time signals can be written as a set of elementary signals, therefore a good understanding of these elementary signals helps with the analysis of more complex signals.
