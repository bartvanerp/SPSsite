Continuous-time signals are often processed in the time domain. However, many more of these domains exist, which offer more insight in the signals. One of the most famous domains is the frequency domain, where the signal is expressed in terms of its frequency components. As an example, high-pitched sounds have a strong frequency content in the high frequency range, whereas low bass tones populate the lower frequency range. This modules covers several continuous-time transforms, where the time domain signal is mapped to another domain.

The concepts covered in this module are:

1. <a href="../continuoussignalprocessing_transforms_spectrum">Spectrum of sinusoidal signals</a> -

2. <a href="../continuoussignalprocessing_transforms_fourier">Fourier Series (FS)</a> -

3. <a href="../continuoussignalprocessing_transforms_ftc">Fourier Transform of Continuous-time signals (FTC)</a> -

4. **Laplace transform** (to be added) - Similarly to continuous-time signals, also systems can be characterized in different domains. Usually this allows for better insight in the system and simplified calculations.
