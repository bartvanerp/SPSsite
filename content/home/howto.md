This platform is targeted to everyone who would like to know more about the field of signal processing.
The website can be divided in two parts.

First, the discipline part provides reading material, screencast videos, exercises and plenty of other supplementary material to get acquainted with a variety of signal processing topics.
This part of the website can perfectly be used for self-study, for learning new topics or for revisiting preliminary study material.

Secondly, the courses part is targeted specifically to TU/e students. Here they can find the study material for the courses offered by the SPS group. Students from outside of the TU/e can also use these courses to learn the presented study content in a more structured way.
