This platform is targeted at everyone who would like to know more about the field of signal processing. The website can be divided into three parts.

First, the ***Info*** tab is meant for TU/e students who want to learn more about how to join the SPS group. This tab displays relevant information for guiding both Bachelor's and Master's students in the process of concluding their studies within the SPS group.

Secondly,  the ***Disciplines*** tab provides reading material, screencast videos, exercises and plenty of other supplementary material to get acquainted with a variety of signal processing topics. This part of the website is very suitable for self-study, for learning new topics, or for revisiting preliminary study material.

Finally, the ***Courses*** tab is targeted specifically to TU/e students. Here, students can find study material for the courses offered by the SPS group. Students from outside TU/e can also use these courses to learn the presented study content in a more structured way.
