Information theory started as a topic in 1948 when Claude E. Shannon published his paper A mathematical theory of communication, where he introduced what communication and information are in a mathematical sense. Shannon created a theory first to quantify and measure the information of a source. Then, by viewing communication as reproduction of information, the theory of communication came into view. All the existing and forthcoming technologies must comply with the theories that Shannon stated, therefore information theory as a topic is the base for everyone working with communication systems, both past, present, and forthcoming.
