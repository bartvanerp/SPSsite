For Master students, the ICT Lab offers you guidance via **master paths**. A master path consists of a set of courses that are coherently aligned and focused on a specific research area. These areas could be  *fiber optics*, *wireless communications*, *radar processing*, and *information security*, and many more. Here we offer you a list of master paths hoping to give you insights and inspiration on how you can engage in the future of information and communication theory.
