The ICT Lab cooperates with industrial partners that frequently have internships available for graduate students with a background in information and communication theory. Get in touch with us if you would like to discuss the opportunity for joining a company like NXP, Philips, NICT Japan, Fujitsu Network Communications (FNC), or Intrinsic-ID. If you are interested in doing an internship with one of our academic partners (e.g. Duke University, Chalmers University of Technology) also donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us.
