The ICT Lab research focuses on data transmission and compression, modulation and error correction, multi-user information theory, information security, and sensing. We study information processing in a broad sense trying to determine fundamental limits, but also at developing the techniques that approach these limits. We use information-theoretical frameworks to model practical scenarios, and to find the optimal performance-complexity trade-offs. These scenarios result from close interaction with national and international industrial collaborators. Application areas include fiber optical communications, next-generation wireless systems, secret-key generation, and radar processing.
