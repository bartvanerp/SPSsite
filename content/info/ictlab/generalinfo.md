At the ICT Lab, we investigate fascinating mechanisms at the foundations of information and communication theory, aiming to develop powerful new models and techniques to push the limits of the current communication technologies.

Our research connects information and communication theory to different research areas, including fiber optical communications, next-generation wireless systems, radar processing, and information security. We investigate these fields through the use of digital signal processing, source coding, and channel coding. The scenarios that we focus on ideally result from close interaction with the industry.
