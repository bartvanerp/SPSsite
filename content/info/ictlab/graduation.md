At the ICT Lab, we provide you with effective guidance to strengthen your skills in a practice-based learning environment. You will be working on real-world problems side by side with leading researchers who are developing the foundations of future communications technologies.

For Master students, we offer **master paths**. A master path consists of a set of courses that are coherently aligned and are focused on specific core research areas, for instance, fiber optics, wireless communications, radar processing, and information security. Here we provide you with some suggested trajectories hoping to give you insights and inspiration on how you can engage in the future of information and communication theory.
