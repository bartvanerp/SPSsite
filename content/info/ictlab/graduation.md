To finish the Master studies you have to enroll in a Final Project. You can discover some of our projects in the [**Master Project Marketplace**](https://master.ele.tue.nl/). There you can find the latest information regarding the registration as well as an extended description of the active projects within the ICT Lab. Just remember that once you are logged in the Marketplace portal, you can filter the list of projects by choosing the capacity group. Choose SPS in the *Research group* option, and select [Alex Alvarado](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/alex-alvarado/) as the *Responsible staff*. If you have any questions regarding one of our projects, please do not hesitate to contact the contact person for the project the project you are interested in.
