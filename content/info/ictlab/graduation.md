At the ICT Lab, you will be working on real-world problems side by side with leading researchers who are developing the foundations of future communications technologies.

For Master students, the ICT Lab offers guidance via **master paths**. A master path consists of a set of courses that are coherently aligned and focused on a specific research area. These areas could be for instance  *fiber optics*, *wireless communications*, *radar processing*, and *information security*. Here we provide you with a list of master paths hoping to give you insights and inspiration on how you can engage in the future of information and communication theory.

To finish the Master studies you have to enroll in a Final Project. You can discover some of our projects in the [**Master Project Marketplace**](https://master.ele.tue.nl/). There you can find the latest information regarding the registration as well as an extended description of the active projects within the ICT Lab. Just remember that once you are logged in the Marketplace portal, you can filter the list of projects by choosing the capacity group. Choose SPS in the *Research group* option, and select [Alex Alvarado](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/alex-alvarado/) as the *Responsible staff*. If you have any questions regarding one of our projects, please do not hesitate to contact the contact person for the project the project you are interested in.
