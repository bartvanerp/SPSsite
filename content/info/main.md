Welcome to the Signal Processing Systems (SPS) group!  At SPS we focus on extracting meaningful information from signals, images, and multivariate data sets. To this end, we combine academic excellence with a strong real-world impact in biomedical instrumentation, medical image analysis, video surveillance, autonomous vehicles, digital wireless and optical communication, hearing aids, and intelligent lighting.

### SPS Organization: Labs
To facility the research activities within our group, SPS has been divided into smaller subgroups called *Labs*. Each lab focuses on specific research areas that are coherently aligned. The labs are constituted by a multidisciplinary team of leading researchers, who are supported by an enthusiastic and determined team of PhD candidates, PDEngs, and technicians.
