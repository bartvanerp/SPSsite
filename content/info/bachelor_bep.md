### What is the Bachelor End Project (BEP)?
You finish your Bachelor studies with the Bachelor End Project (BEP). BEP assignments correspond with the ongoing research activities of our labs. The BEP includes several professional skills such as presenting, reporting and acquiring information. These basic subjects are therefore not accounted for separately in the third year. The BEP starts with a kick-off session in week 8 of quartile 2 and finishes with a closing session in week 7 of quartile 4. The BEP assignments must be carried out during quartiles 3 and 4 of the 3rd year,  and the hours for this subject will be timetabled for you.

Students may start their Bachelor’s final project if they have obtained at least 120 credits, including
- The compulsory study components of the first year of the Bachelor’s program
- Two elective study components as stated in the Program and Examination Regulations 2016-2017 for the Bachelor’s program in Electrical Engineering.

### How to register for a project?
The organization of the Bachelor End Project is arranged centrally for the Electrical Engineering and Automotive programs.
An overview of all available projects from all capacity groups can be found at [**BEP Marketplace**](https://bep.ele.tue.nl/).
There you can also find the latest information regarding the registration, deadlines and professional skills.

If you would like to do a Bachelor End Project within the Signal Processing Systems groups, you can filter the list of projects on the capacity group. If you have any questions regarding one of our projects, please do not hesitate to contact the responsible person for that project.
