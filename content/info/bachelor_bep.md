### What is the Bachelor End Project (BEP)?
The Bachelor End project (BEP, year 3) is the final project of the major Electrical Engineering, and an assessment of the academic proficiency. Students may start their Bachelor End ’s final Project if they have obtained at least 120 credits, including
- The compulsory study components of the first year of the Bachelor’s program
- Two elective study components as stated in the Program and Examination Regulations 2016-2017 for the Bachelor’s program in Electrical Engineering.

BEP assignments are linked to the ongoing research activities of our labs. The BEP includes several professional skills such as presenting, reporting and acquiring information. The BEP starts with a kick-off session in week 8 of quartile 2 and finishes with a closing session in week 7 of quartile 4. The BEP assignments must be carried out during quartiles 3 and 4 of the 3rd year, and the hours for this subject will be timetabled for you.

### How to register for a project?
The organization of the Bachelor End Projects for the department of Electrical Engineering is arranged centrally. An overview of all available projects from all capacity groups can be found at the [**BEP Marketplace**](https://bep.ele.tue.nl/).
There you can also find the latest information regarding the registration, deadlines and professional skills.

If you would like to do a Bachelor End Project within the Signal Processing Systems groups, you can filter the list of projects on the capacity group. If you have any questions regarding one of our projects, please do not hesitate to contact the responsible person for that project.
