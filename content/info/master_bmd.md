## Research focus
We develop algorithms for the interpretation of biomedical signals and data acquired with a variety of sensors, ranging from ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, up to electrophysiological and photoplethysmographic recording. The lab positions itself on the edge between data-driven and physics-driven analysis through a continuous effort towards understanding the application domain and modeling the full measurement chain: (patho)physiological sources, sensing physics, and signal acquisition. To this end, research is carried out in tight collaboration with our clinical and industrial partners. The main application areas are oncology, cardiovascular, gynecology-perinatology, sleep, perioperative care, neurology, and neuromuscular research.

## Courses
Education is tightly linked to research. Therefore, the main activity consists of supervision of student projects ranging from Bachelor, Traineeship, and Graduation projects. Find below an overview of the courses offered by the

## Graduation
To finish the Master studies you have to enroll in a Final Project. You can discover some of our projects in the <a href="https://master.ele.tue.nl/" target="_blank">Master marketplace</a>. There you can find the latest information regarding the registration as well as an extended description of the active projects within the ICT Lab. Just remember that once you are logged in the Marketplace portal, you can filter the list of projects by choosing the capacity group. Choose SPS in the *Research group* option, and select <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/biomedical-diagnostics-lab/persons/" target="_blank">any of our researchers</a> as the *Responsible staff*. If you have any questions regarding one of our projects, please do not hesitate to contact the responsible for the project you are interested in.

<br>

## Internships
Given the international nature of the BM/d Research Team, several students interested in biomedical applications of signal analysis come from different European countries to carry out their master projects within the Erasmus Exchange Program. A number of established international connections also enable us to arrange external projects abroad, in countries such as Italy, Denmark, Rumania, and USA. Obviously, next to supervision, also a number of specialized courses are given, especially in the area of sensing and clinical monitoring. If you are interested in enrolling an internship with one of our partners donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us.
