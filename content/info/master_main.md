### General info
The SPS group offers students in their master's program an excellent opportunity to collaborate on state-of-the-art research in numerous research fields.
Our fields of research include biomedical diagnostics, communication theory, surveillance, image and video processing, intelligent agents, intelligent lighting, and much more.
Our research activities tie in perfectly with model-based signal processing, data-driven signal processing, and artificial intelligence.

### Joining an SPS lab
Students can explore our different fields of research by checking the areas each lab focuses on:

- [Bayesian Intelligent Autonomous Systems Lab](../master_biaslab) (BIASlab)
- [Biomedical Diagnostics Lab](../master_bmd) (BM/d)
- [Information and Communication Theory Lab](../master_ictlab) (ICT Lab)
- [Lighting and IoT Lab](../master_lighting) (L&IoT Lab)
- [NeuroPlatform](../master_neuroplatform)
- [Mobile Perception Systems Lab](../master_mpslab) (MPS)
- [Video Coding and Architectures](../master_vca) (VCA)

If you find yourself on this page, you have probably already decided that you want to graduate within the SPS group. Perfect!
Now you need to choose in which of the labs you would like to graduate. To help you make a well-informed decision, each lab has provided a page with information about their research activities.
> Most importantly, choose the research direction which you like the most.

You can switch between different labs as you like, as long as you comply with the graduation requirements of the lab that you want to be graduating in.

{{% alert note %}}
The signal processing systems group has organized its research activities in different labs. This leads to decentralized procedures for internships, and graduating. *Therefore please read this page carefully!*

### Contact persons
Every lab has its own contact person whom you should contact when you have questions about elective courses, internships, graduating, and graduation requirements. You can find the contact persons for each of the labs on their corresponding pages.

### General questions
For general questions regarding education in the SPS group, you can contact the mentors of our group <a href="mailto:s.zinger@tue.nl?subject=[SPS Education]%20{specify question here}">dr. Sveta Zinger</a> or <a href="mailto:a.alvarado@tue.nl?subject=[SPS Education]%20{specify question here}">dr. Alex Alvarado</a>. For all lab-specific questions, please contact the responsible for the corresponding lab.

In case you feel like the information on this platform is outdated or incorrect, please mail us <a href="mailto:s.zinger@tue.nl;a.alvarado@tue.nl?cc=sps.education@tue.nl&subject=[SPS Education]%20{specify question here}">here</a>.


### Graduating within the SPS group
Everyone graduating within the SPS group needs to comply with following a specific set of courses. In the first place, all students who want to join SPS **have to** enroll in the following specialization courses.

**Specialization**
- Adaptive array signal processing (5SSC0)
- Bayesian machine learning and information processing (5SSD0)

Keep track of the quartiles these courses are offered and plan in advance by adding them to the **courses package** of your Professional Development Plan.

In the first quartile (Q1) you need to select three core courses from the set listed <a href="https://studiegids.tue.nl/opleidingen/graduate-school/masters-programs/electrical-engineering/curriculum/core-courses/" target="_blank">here</a>.
From this set of courses, some are labeled as either important or preferred by the SPS group.

**Must have**
- Statistical signal processing (5CTA0)
- Non-linear optimization (2DME10)

**Nice to have**
- Complex Analysis (2DME30)
- Numerical methods in Electrical Engineering (5CPA0)
- Modeling dynamics (5CSA0)

In case you wish not to follow the important courses, because you prefer to follow others, please contact the contact person of the lab you wish to graduate in to confirm whether this is a problem.

Each lab might have extra requirements on graduating in their lab. Please have a look at the different lab pages to find out what these extra requirements are. If you want to make sure that you choose elective courses that are adequate for graduating within a lab, please contact the lab contact person.

### Master marketplace
The information of the available Graduation Projects and Internships for the department of Electrical Engineering is arranged centrally at the <a href="https://master.ele.tue.nl/" target="_blank">Master marketplace</a>. There you can also find the latest information regarding the registration, deadlines and active internships.

### Internships
In the master's program, you need to do an internship for 15 ECTS, which you can optionally extend to 20 ECTS. Please have a look at the Master marketplace to see which internships are being offered by the SPS group. The internship does not have to be with the lab that you will be graduating from but could serve as an important introduction to your graduation project. In case you would like to ask about any other options for internships (such as going abroad), please contact the contact person of the corresponding lab. If you have found an internship on your own with a company or institution, try to find a well-suited SPS staff member who does research on a similar topic and who can properly supervise you during your internship.


### Graduation project
The graduation projects are all centrally listed on the Master marketplace. On this page, you can enroll easily for these projects with your TU/e account. In case you have a great idea for a graduation project, please contact the contact person of the lab to see what possibilities there are.

Graduation projects can also be carried out in collaboration with a company. If you are eager to work with the industry, contact your preferred lab to see what options they have available. Some of the options are also listed in the Master marketplace. When you have found a graduation project with a company on your own, make sure to discuss this with the lab you wish to graduate in, in order to arrange suitable and qualified supervision from the lab.

> Good luck during your studies!
