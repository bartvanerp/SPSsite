### General info
The SPS group offers students in their master's program an excellent opportunity to collaborate on state-of-the-art research in numerous research fields.
Our fields of research include biomedical diagnostics, communication theory, surveillance, image and video processing, intelligent agents, intelligent lighting, and much more.
Our research activities tie in perfectly with model-based signal processing, data-driven signal processing, and artificial intelligence.

### Joining an SPS lab
Students can explore our different fields of research by checking the areas each lab focuses on:

- Bayesian Intelligent Autonomous Systems Lab (BIAS lab)
- Biomedical Diagnostics Lab (BM/d)
- [Information and Communication Theory Lab](../master_ictlab) (ICT Lab)
- Lighting and IoT Lab (L&IoT slab)
- Neu3CA
- Mobile Perception Systems Lab (MPS)
- Video Coding and Architectures (VCA)

If you find yourself on this page, you have probably already decided that you want to graduate within the SPS group. Perfect!
Now you need to choose in which of the labs you would like to graduate. To help you make a well-informed decision, each lab has provided a page with information about their research activities.
> Most importantly, choose the research direction which you like the most.

You can switch between different labs as you like, as long as you comply with the graduation requirements of the lab that you want to be graduating in.

{{% alert warning %}}
In contrast to the other capacity groups of the Department of Electrical Engineering, the signal processing systems group has organized its research activities in different labs. This leads to different procedures for contacting mentors, signing codes of conduct, internships, and graduating. *Therefore please read this page carefully!*

### Mentors and code of conduct
Every lab has its own contact person whom you should contact when you have questions about elective courses, internships, graduating, and graduation requirements. You can find the contact persons for each of the labs on their corresponding pages.

During your master's program, you have to sign the code of conduct in presence of the contact person for the group in which you wish to graduate. This person is **not** the contact person that is listed in the study guide of the Department of Electrical Engineering. Instead, you should contact the contact person of the lab you wish to graduate in.

### Graduating within the SPS group
Everyone graduating within the SPS group needs to comply with following a specific set of courses. In the first place, all students who want to join SPS **have to** enroll in the following specialization courses

**Mandatory**
- Adaptive array signal processing (5SSC0)
- Bayesian machine learning and information processing (5SSD0)

Keep track of the quartiles these courses are offered and plan in advance by adding them to the **courses package** of your Professional Development Plan.

In the first quartile (Q1) you need to select three core courses from the set listed <a href="https://studiegids.tue.nl/opleidingen/graduate-school/masters-programs/electrical-engineering/curriculum/core-courses/" target="_blank">here</a>.
From this set of courses, some are labeled as either important or preferred by the SPS group.

**Important**
- Statistical signal processing (5CTA0)
- Non-linear optimization (2DME10)

**Preferred**
- Complex Analysis (2DME30)
- Numerical methods in Electrical Engineering (5CPA0)
- Modeling dynamics (5CSA0)

In case you wish not to follow the important courses, because you prefer to follow others, please contact the contact person of the lab you wish to graduate in to confirm whether this is a problem.

Each lab might demand extra requirements on graduating in their lab. Please have a look at the different lab pages to find out what these extra requirements are. If you want to make sure that you choose elective courses that are adequate for graduating within a lab, please contact the lab contact person.

### Master marketplace
The information of the available Graduation Projects and Internships for the department of Electrical Engineering is arranged centrally at the <a href="https://master.ele.tue.nl/" target="_blank">Master marketplace</a>. There you can also find the latest information regarding the registration, deadlines and active internships.

### Internships
In the master's program, you need to do an internship for 15 or 20 ECTS. Please have a look at the Master marketplace to see which internships are being offered by the SPS group. The internship does not have to be with the lab that you will be graduating from but could serve as an important introduction to your graduation project. In case you would like to ask about any other options for internships (such as going abroad), please contact the contact person of the corresponding lab.


### Graduation project
The graduation projects are all centrally listed on the Master marketplace. On this page, you can enroll easily for these projects with your TU/e account. In case you have a great idea for a graduation project, please contact the contact person of the lab to see what possibilities there are.

Graduation projects can also be carried out in collaboration with a company. If you are eager to work with the industry, contact your preferred lab to see what options they have available. Some of the options are also listed in the Master marketplace. When you have found a graduation project with a company on your own, make sure to discuss this with the lab you wish to graduate in, in order to arrange suitable and qualified supervision from the lab.

> Good luck during your studies!
