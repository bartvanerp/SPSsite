In the Bachelor program the university offers coherent packages, which are selected groups of courses that relate to a single theme. 
Below you can find an overview of the coherent packages offered by the department of electrical engineering.
For the most up-to-date information you can visit <a href="https://studiegids.tue.nl/opleidingen/bachelor-college/majors/electrical-engineering/curriculum/electives/coherent-packages/?L=0">this website</a>. 
The Signal Processing Systems (SPS) group also offers several courses in these packages, so if you are interested in following these courses, you might want to consider following all the courses of the coherent package.
In the overview below the SPS specific courses are highlighted in **boldface**.
