## Research focus
The Video Coding and Architectures research group is part of the Signal Processing Systems department of the Eindhoven University of Technology. The research spans areas of video analysis, image/video segmentation, object-oriented and 3D video compression that underpin systems-oriented research on video coding and architectures. This work pursues state-of-the-art video functionality at high cost-efficiency (e.g. for real-time aspects and/or mobile applications), through a combination of novel algorithms and architectures.

## Courses
The courses offered by the BIASlab tie in perfectly with our research focus. In BIASlab we focus on Bayesian machine learning which you will learn in the specialization course of the SPS master. As a background we would highly recommend you to follow the fundamentals of machine learning course, in which we teach you the basics of the field of machine learning. As all machine learning requires proper software engineering, we also learn you how to properly write software for machine learning applications.
