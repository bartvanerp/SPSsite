## Research focus
We study novel concepts for Smart and IoT Connected Buildings and also for Wireless Optical Communication (LiFi). One of our success factors is that start by deeping the scientific understanding of lighting and communication via light. We develop effective, yet computationally-efficient non-linear equalizer structures to enhance LiFi, by first improving the models of the photonic response of LED junctions, studying semiconductor physics. We translate these new insights into efficient equalizer structures, optimized modulation methods and suitable electronic driver circuits. To make LiFi robust against interruptions of a light beam, we develop OFDM MIMO schemes in which multiple distributed light sources cooperate to boost reliability and performance.

Another research track is the translation of scientific insights in the human experience of light into computer-interpretable control algorithms that optimize acute effects on comfort and productivity jointly with the impact on circadian rhythms and sleep and energy efficiency. We study how such dynamic control systems can work with imperfect sensors and constrained IoT communication networks.We cooperate internationally with major institutions and companies, in national and EU projects, and in particular we have a track record of cooperation with Signify (Philips Lighting).

## Graduation
To finish the Master studies you have to enroll in a Graduation Project. You can discover some of our projects in the <a href="https://master.ele.tue.nl/" target="_blank">Master marketplace</a>. There you can find the latest information regarding the registration as well as an extended description of the active projects within our lab. Just remember that once you are logged in the Marketplace portal, you can filter the list of projects by choosing the capacity group. Choose SPS in the *Research group* option, and select <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/jean-paul-linnartz/" target="_blank">Jean-Paul Linnartz</a> as the *Responsible staff*. If you have any questions regarding one of our projects, please do not hesitate to contact the responsible for the project you are interested in.

## Internships
The lighting and IoT Lab cooperates with industrial partners that frequently have internships available for graduate students with a background in machine learning. Get in touch with us to discuss the available options for an internship. We are happy to shape the internship according to your own wishes and interests.
